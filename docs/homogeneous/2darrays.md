# Two-Dimensional Arrays

### Arrays that we have consider up to now are one-dimensional arrays, a single line of elements. 
- Often data come naturally in the form of
 a table, e.g., spreadsheet, which needs a two-dimensional array.


### Two-dimensional (2D) arrays are indexed by two subscripts:
-  row 
-  column 


### A two-dimensional array is the simplest form of a multidimensional array.

 A two-dimensional array is, in essence, 
 a list of one-dimensional arrays. 
 
 ## To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size [x, y], you would write something as follows:
```go
var arrayName [ x ][ y ] variable_type
```
