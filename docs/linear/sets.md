# Sets

## Set is an abstract data type
 - that can store certain values
    - without any particular order 
    - and no repeated values
 
 ### It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set.
- In mathematics (particularly set theory)
    - a finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements.
- (informally) a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting. 

### Go does not have Sets by default but there are ways of imitating a Set in Go.
