# Queues

a queue data structure
- is a collection of entities
    - that are maintained in a sequence

 can be modified by the addition of entities 
 - at one end of the sequence the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. 
  
  By convention, 
  the end of the sequence at which elements are added
   is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue,
   
    and the end at which elements are removed
     is called the head
      or front of the queue, 
      
analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

enqueue 
- The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue 

dequeue
- The operation of removing an element from the front 
 
 Other operations may also be allowed:
 
 Often including a peek or front operation 
- that returns the value of the next element 
    - to be dequeued without dequeuing it.
