# Queues

### A queue data structure
- is a collection of entities
    - that are maintained in a sequence

 # Modification or Addition of entities 
 - at one end of the sequence the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. 
  
## By convention: 
   
     
### Back/Tail/Rear of the Queue >>

- The end of the sequence at which elements are added
  
### Head/Front of the Queue >>
- The end at which elements are removed


### Analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

enqueue 
- The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue 

dequeue
- The operation of removing an element from the front 
 
 ## Other operations may also be allowed:
 
 Often including a peek or front operation 
- that returns the value of the next element 
    - to be dequeued without dequeuing it.
